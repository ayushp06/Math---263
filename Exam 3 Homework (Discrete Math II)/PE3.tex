\eeq
\beq Prove Kruskal's Theorem\\

Base Case: Initially, the forest consists of isolated vertices, which are indeed trees. Adding the smallest edge that connects two vertices will not form a cycle, as there are no other edges to form a cycle with.\\

Induction Hypothesis: Assume that after adding k - 1 edges to the forest, the algorithm forms a collection of trees where adding the kth edge does not create a cycle.\\

Inductive Step: We will show that after adding the kth edge, the resulting collection of trees remains acyclic.\\

When Kruskal's algorithm adds the kth edge, it must connect two different trees, otherwise, it would create a cycle. By the cut property, this edge must be the minimum weight edge across any cut that separates the vertices into two disjoint sets. Therefore, adding this edge maintains the acyclic property, forming a forest of k trees.\\

Conclusion: Since Kruskal's algorithm adds edges without creating cycles, and each edge added is the lightest edge across some cut, it eventually constructs a minimum spanning tree.\\

Thus, Kruskal's algorithm produces a minimum spanning tree.\\
